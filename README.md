# Week--1
Smart Seed Suggestion - AI/ML-based seed recommendation system using STM32 sensors, soil pH, weather and crop history for sustainable agriculture.
# 🌱 Smart Seed Suggestion System
**AI/ML-based Sustainable Agriculture Project**

## 📌 Problem Statement
Farmers struggle to pick the right seed for the next cycle. Wrong choices hurt yield, waste water/fertilizer, and cost money. We will suggest the best seed using soil pH, moisture, weather/climate and previous crop data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect: soil pH, moisture, temperature, humidity, water quality, past crop.
- Train an ML model to recommend the next seed/crop.
- Show result on LCD / mobile app / web dashboard.

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech
- **Hardware**: STM32, pH sensor, soil moisture, DHT11/22, Keil uVision, Proteus.
- **AI/Software**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn/TensorFlow, GitHub.

## 🏗️ Workflow
Sensors → STM32 reads → (send data) → ML model → Best seed suggestion → Display.

## 📂 Repository Structure (planned)
