# ðŸ”§ Hardware Design - Smart Seed Suggestion System

This folder contains all the **hardware-related resources** for the project.  
The hardware mainly involves **STM32 microcontroller**, **sensors**, and **circuit simulations**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Components Used
- **STM32 (Cortex-M series)** â€“ main controller  
- **Soil pH Sensor** â€“ to measure soil acidity/alkalinity  
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** â€“ to check water content  
- **DHT11/DHT22** â€“ for temperature & humidity  
- **Rain Sensor** â€“ for rainfall detection  
- **LCD / OLED Display** â€“ to show results locally  
- **WiFi / LoRa module** â€“ to send data to cloud (optional)

---

## ðŸ–¥ Development Tools
- **Keil uVision IDE** â€“ to write and debug STM32 code  
- **Proteus** â€“ for circuit simulation & testing  
- **ST-Link** â€“ for programming & debugging hardware  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files to be added here
- `main.c` â†’ Firmware code for STM32  
- `sensors.c / sensors.h` â†’ Drivers for sensors  
- `schematic.png` â†’ Circuit diagram  
- `simulation.dsn` â†’ Proteus simulation file  

---

## âš¡ Workflow
1. Sensors collect **soil, weather, and water data**.  
2. STM32 processes the data and sends it to the **AI/ML model**.  
3. Display results on LCD or transmit to cloud for prediction.
