# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model - Smart Seed Suggestion System

This folder contains all the **AI/ML-related resources** for the project.  
The ML model will analyze **soil, weather, and historical crop data** to suggest the **best seeds** for sustainable farming.

---

## ðŸ“Œ ML Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Soil pH, moisture, NPK values (from sensors or dataset)
   - Temperature, humidity, rainfall (from weather APIs or sensors)
   - Crop history (previous season data)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Remove missing values
   - Normalize/scale sensor data
   - Encode categorical data (like crop names)

3. **Model Training**
   - Algorithms to try:
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Logistic Regression
     - Neural Networks (for advanced version)
   - Target â†’ Suggested Seed/Crop

4. **Model Deployment**
   - Export trained model as `.pkl` (Pickle) file
   - Deploy on **STM32 (basic rules)** or on a **cloud server (full ML model)**

## ðŸ“‚ Files to be added here
- `dataset.csv` â†’ Training dataset (soil, weather, crop data)  
- `model_training.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook for ML training  
- `seed_recommendation.pkl` â†’ Saved ML model  
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Required Python libraries  

---

## âš¡ Example Prediction
Input:
- Soil pH = 6.5  
- Soil Moisture = 40%  
- Temperature = 28Â°C  
- Previous Crop = Rice  

Output:
- Recommended Seed â†’ **Wheat** ðŸŒ¾
